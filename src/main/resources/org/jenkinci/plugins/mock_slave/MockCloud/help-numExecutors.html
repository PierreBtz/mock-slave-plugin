<div>
    Number of executors to allot per mock slave.
    If set to one, the slave automatically adopts a “one-shot” retention strategy:
    it is killed immediately after the build finishes, and a new slave must be provisioned for any other build.
    If greater than one, the slave will accept new builds, staying online for at least one minute after the last one finishes.
